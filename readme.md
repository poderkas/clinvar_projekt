## About
This is a data science project built on the ClinVar dataset from Kaggle. Our classifier attempts to predict if a given genetic variant will have it's clinical significance classified differently between laboratories.

## Installation
In order to run the notebook file successfully you need to install Anaconda and the following additional libraries through Anaconda prompt:
